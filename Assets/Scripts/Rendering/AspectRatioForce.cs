// Once you've saved your new camera script, add the script to the camera by dragging the script from the Project window onto the camera's listing in the Hierarchy window. Now when you run your game the camera's viewport will be scaled and positioned to match the desired aspect ratio*.
//
// Now the next step is to add a second camera to render the "black bar" region of the screen. While you can choose to render whatever the second camera is pointed at, in most cases you'll want to set the camera to render only a flat color such as black. To do this:
// Create the camera by choosing GameObject -> Create Other -> Camera from the editor's menu.
//     Set the camera's depth value to -2 so it's rendered underneath the main camera (whose depth value defaults to -1).
// To set the black bar region to a solid color, set the camera's Clear Flags to "Solid Color", set the Culling Mask to "Nothing", and finally the Background to the desired color.
//     That's all you need to do. Now your game will run with the desired aspect ratio regardless of the user's choice of resolution.
